      I am studying Computer science at Lovely Professional University and have
      a great passion to learn new things. I am a web and software developer with great interest in machine learning. Also, implementing the
      things that I have learned in the form of projects is something I consider
      most important. Gaining knowledge about every possible thing, putting it
      in use and then passing it on is the ultimate goal of my life.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><h4>Box Shooter</h4></p>
        <p><b>Key Skills</b>: Game Development, Unity3D</p>
        <p>
          <b>Description</b>: In this, I build a game where user shoots cubes to
          get points. There are three types of cubes- +5,+10 and +0. The game
          stops when a cube with +0 point is hit. The cubes has a lifespan that
          optimizes the number of cubes that can spawn in game.

        <p><h4>Billing form</h4></p>
        <p><b>Key Skills</b>: HTML5, CSS, Javascript</p>
        <p>
          <b>Description</b>: I made a website that used html5 for its content.
          I made a form including tables. I used CSS to make its design
          responsive in other devices. Then I used Javascript to add more
          features.

        <p><h4>Movie review sentiment analysis</h4></p>
        <p><b>Key Skills</b>: Python, Web Scraping</p>
        <p>
          Description: I had to analyse the sentiment of audience about a
          particular movie of the user's choice. For that I took the help of
          IMDB website and using python libraries, I sent request to that
          website and got the response in the form of html tags and texts of
          comments using urllib.request. Next, I used beautiful soup to remove
          html tags. After this, I split entire comments into strings. Then
          using for loop, I removed punctuations and then analysed the sentiment
          of the list using inbuilt textblob library.

          <b>Description</b>: The node.js implementation lets you create, list, read and remove notes. 
          But first you will have to install some modules present in "package.json". 
          Note.js contains these four commands while App.js initializes them.

          note.json is the file in which the created notes will be stored and fetched.
